# Capstone Project: 
# House Price Prediction using the arms Dataset

This project aims to predict house prices using a subset of the American Housing Surveys (AHS) Public Use Files - Repeated Measures (arms) dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
* **SquareFeet:** Total living area of the house.
* **YearBuilt:** Year the house was constructed.
* **Number of Bathrooms:** Total number of bathrooms in the house.
* **Number of Bedrooms:** Total number of bedrooms in the house.
* **Neighbourhood:** Categorical feature representing the neighborhood.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   * Handle missing values
   * Encode categorical features (e.g., Neighbourhood)
   * Normalize numerical features

2. **Model Selection and Training:**
   * Experiment with various regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   * Train models on the prepared dataset
   * Tune hyperparameters to optimize performance

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   * Evaluate models using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   * Choose the best-performing model

## Results and Insights
* **Model Performance:** Present the performance metrics of the selected model.
* **Feature Importance:** Analyze the importance of different features in the prediction process.
* **Visualizations:** Use visualizations to illustrate trends and patterns in the data.

## Future Work
* Explore more advanced techniques like deep learning
* Develop a web application to deploy the model

**To run the code:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
